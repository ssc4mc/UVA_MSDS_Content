# Printing basics
print("This is a simple print statement")

# Printing using special characters
# Tab character ( \t )
print("Hello,\tWorld! (With a tab character)")

# Inserting a new line (line feed) character ( \n )
print("Line one\nLine two, with newline character")

# Concatenation in strings: 
# Use plus sign ( + ) to concatenate the parts of the string
print("Concatenation," + "\t" + "in strings with tab in middle")

# If you wanted to print special characters
# Printing quotes
print('Printing "quotes" within a string') # mixing single and double quotes

# What if you needed to print special characters like (\) or (') or (")
print('If I want to print \'single quotes\' in a string, use backslash!')
print("If I want to print \"double quotes\" in a string, use backslash!")
print('If I want to print \\the backslash\\ in a string, also use backslash!')

# \\     Backslash (\)
# \'     Single quote (')
# \"     Double quote (")
# \n     ASCII Linefeed
